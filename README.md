# Breakdance Freeze/Powermove Object Detection

This project aims to train breakdancing powermoves (windmills, flares, airflares, etc.) and freezes (airchair, baby-freeze, headstand, etc.) to the pre-trained [Ultralytics YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

The motivation for this project comes from:
- I'm a breakdancer myself
- There are various styles of powermoves/freezes
   - Creating a rating system for these moves would quantify the quality of these moves for breakdancers.
- It allows me to utilize the skills I garnered from [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction).
